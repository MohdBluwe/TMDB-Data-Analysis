# TMDB-Data-Analysis
This project is about analyzing the data that were taken from Kaggle website and doing the basic steps of data analysis

This is a project in Udacity Data Analyst course where we asked to choose a data from Kaggle website to analyse it, for this project I choose the TMDB data because I like movies 
and it was the easiest data to clean between the others. Also because it was a bit cleaned from source. You will see a CSV file were the raw data attached and then HTML and IPYNB files 
to illustrate the steps and the codes that how the data were analysed. In most of the cells, there's a comment that describes what does the code mean.
